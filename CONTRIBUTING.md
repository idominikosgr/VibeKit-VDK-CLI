## Getting Started

Before you begin contributing, please:

1. Familiarize yourself with the [VibeKit VDK CLI Guide](./GUIDE.md)
2. Check the [Issues](https://github.com/idominikosgr/VibeKit-VDK-CLI/issues) for open tasks or create a new issue to discuss your proposed changes.

## Development Setup

To set up a local development environment:

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/idominikosgr/VibeKit-VDK-CLI.git
cd VibeKit-VDK-CLI

# 2. Install dependencies
npm install

# 3. Link the package for local development
npm link

# 4. Verify the installation by running the help command
vdk --help
```

Now, any changes you make to the source code will be immediately reflected when you run the `vdk` command.

## Testing Guidelines

We maintain high code quality standards. Please follow these guidelines:

- All new features should be thoroughly tested manually.
- Bug fixes should include verification that the issue is resolved.

### Manual Testing

Test your changes in a separate test project:

1. **Initialize VDK**: Run `vdk init` inside a test project and follow the prompts.
2. **Check Status**: Run `vdk status` to ensure the configuration is correct.
3. **Validate Changes**: Ensure your changes work as expected and do not introduce any regressions.

## Code Style

We follow a consistent code style across the project:

- Use ESLint and follow the project's `.eslintrc` configuration.
- Write clear, self-documenting code with meaningful variable and function names.
- Include JSDoc comments for all public API functions.
- Follow the existing project structure and patterns.
- Use modern JavaScript features (ES modules, async/await, etc.).

## Pull Request Process

1. **Fork the repository** and create a new branch for your feature or bug fix.
2. **Make your changes** and ensure they adhere to the code style and testing guidelines.
3. **Commit your changes** with a clear and descriptive commit message.
4. **Push your branch** to your forked repository.
5. **Submit a Pull Request** to the `main` branch of the original repository.
