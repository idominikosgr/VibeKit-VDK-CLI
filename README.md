## Installation

### Option 1: Interactive Setup (Recommended)

1. Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/idominikosgr/CodePilotRules.git
cd CodePilotRules
```

2. Run the setup wizard:

```bash
node setup-wizard.js
```

3. Follow the interactive prompts to configure CodePilotRules for your project:
   - Enter your project path
   - Select your IDE or AI coding tool (Cursor AI, Windsurf, GitHub Copilot, VS Code, etc.)
   - Choose your primary framework
   - Select your programming language
   - Pick your technology stack
   - Select additional technologies
   - Choose AI tools to configure

The wizard will automatically create the appropriate directory structure and copy the relevant rule files to your project.

### Option 2: Manual Installation

1. Clone this repository into your project:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/idominikosgr/CodePilotRules.git .ai
```

2. Customize the project-specific files:

- Edit `.ai/rules/01-project-context.mdc` with your project details
- Modify `.ai/rules/02-common-errors.mdc` with project-specific anti-patterns
- Update `.ai/rules/03-mcp-configuration.mdc` with your MCP server configuration

## Usage

### For Cursor AI Users

CodePilotRules will be automatically loaded when you use Cursor AI in a project containing these rules.

### For GitHub Copilot Users

While Copilot doesn't directly support loading external rules, you can still benefit by:

1. Keeping the rules visible in your workspace
2. Referencing specific rule files in your prompts

### For ChatGPT/Claude Users

Upload relevant rule files to provide context when working on specific tasks.

### Activating a Task Rule

You can explicitly request a specific task rule:

```
Please refactor this code using @tasks/Refactor-Code.mdc
```

Or the AI might activate a task rule semantically based on your request.

### Providing Project Context

For new projects, you should update the project context file:

```
Please update the project context with our React/Node.js stack and component structure.
```

### Documenting Common Errors

Add project-specific patterns to avoid:

```
Please add a common error pattern about our naming convention for API routes.
```

### Configuring MCP Awareness

To ensure the AI knows which MCP servers are available and how they are configured:

1. Open Cursor Settings (Cmd+, or Ctrl+,)
2. Go to the 'MCP' section
3. Open your global `~/.cursor/mcp.json` file via the provided button/link
4. Make sure `mcp.json` is the active file in your editor
5. In the AI chat, ask: "Please populate `.ai/rules/03-mcp-configuration.mdc` based on the attached `mcp.json` context."
6. The AI should read the attached `mcp.json` context and fill in the details about each server in `03-mcp-configuration.mdc`.

## Benefits

- More accurate code assistance based on your project context
- Stack-specific guidance for different technology combinations
- Consistent response format and quality
- Reduced need to repeat instructions
- Improved code quality and adherence to best practices

## Customization

The rule files use a consistent Markdown format that's easy to customize for your specific needs. See the `Cursor-Rules.md` file at the project root for detailed formatting guidelines and best practices.

## Updating

To update the standard `tasks/`, `languages/`, `technologies/` rules and the core `00-core-agent.mdc`, while preserving your customized `01-project-context.mdc` and `02-common-errors.mdc`:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/idominikosgr/CodePilotRules/main/install.sh | sh -s -- --upgrade
```
*Note: The upgrade process preserves `03-mcp-configuration.mdc`. If new standard MCP servers are added to CodePilotRules in the future, you may need to manually update your `03-mcp-configuration.mdc` or ask the AI to regenerate it.*
