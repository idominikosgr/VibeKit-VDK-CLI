This document outlines the development roadmap, feature priorities, and future direction for the VibeKit VDK CLI.

## 📊 Current Status: Q2 2025

### 🚀 Recent Achievements

✅ **Complete Rebranding** - Successfully rebranded the entire project from "Vibe Coding Rules" to "VibeKit VDK CLI".
✅ **CLI Refactor** - Rebuilt the CLI from the ground up using `commander.js` for a robust and modern command structure (`vdk init`, `vdk status`, etc.).
✅ **Simplified Core Logic** - Streamlined the setup wizard and core logic for a better user experience.
✅ **Updated Documentation** - Overhauled all documentation (`GUIDE.md`, `README.md`, etc.) to reflect the new branding and commands.
✅ **New Package Identity** - Established the official npm package as `@vdk/cli`.

## 🎯 Active Development & Next Steps

### 🔥 High Priority Features (Q3 2025)

#### 1. Implement Core Command Logic
**Status**: 🔄 In Progress
- **`vdk deploy`**: Build out the logic to deploy the generated rules to various AI assistants.
- **`vdk update`**: Implement the functionality to update the CLI and its rule templates from a central repository.

#### 2. Enhance Rule Generation
**Status**: 📋 Planned
- Develop more sophisticated project analysis to generate more accurate and context-rich rules during the `vdk init` process.

#### 3. Expand Template Library
**Status**: 📋 Planned
- Create a wider range of default rule templates for more languages, frameworks, and tools.

## 📈 Long-term Vision (2026+)

### AI-Native Development Environment
- **Seamless Integration**: AI understands projects as deeply as a senior developer.
- **Proactive Assistance**: The AI anticipates needs and suggests improvements based on VDK rules.
- **Collaborative Intelligence**: The AI acts as a true development team member, enforcing standards and sharing context.

### Ecosystem Expansion
- **Plugin Marketplace**: Create a rich ecosystem of extensions and integrations for VDK.
- **API Platform**: Allow third-party tools to integrate with the VDK rule system.
- **Community Hub**: Build a central place for the community to share rule templates and best practices.
