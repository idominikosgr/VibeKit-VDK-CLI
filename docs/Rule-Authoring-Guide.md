## Introduction

VibeKit VDK CLI uses **MDC (Markdown Customization)** files to provide context-aware guidance to AI coding assistants. These files follow a specific format designed to be both human-readable and easily parseable by AI systems.

### What are .mdc Files?

MDC files are special Markdown files that contain structured instructions for AI coding assistants. They combine:
- **YAML metadata header** with key information about the rule
- **Markdown sections** that define specific behaviors, preferences, or knowledge
- **Code examples** to illustrate correct implementation
- **Special directives** for AI-specific behavior

### Purpose

MDC files enhance AI assistants by providing:
- **Project-specific context** - Tech stack, conventions, patterns
- **Specialized workflows** - Task-specific guidance and procedures
- **Memory management** - Session continuity and decision tracking
- **Quality standards** - Best practices and anti-patterns

## Understanding .mdc Files

### Basic File Structure

Every `.mdc` file follows this structure:

```yaml
---
# YAML frontmatter (metadata)
title: "Descriptive Title for the Rule"
description: "Brief description of what the rule does and when to use it"
version: "1.0.0"
author: "Your Name"
lastUpdated: "2025-01-14"
tags: ["tag1", "tag2", "tag3"]
alwaysApply: false
globs: ["**/*.js", "**/*.ts"]
priority: 65
platforms: ["vscode", "cursor", "windsurf"]
---

# Rule Title

## 1. Role & Responsibility
Defines the AI assistant's role and primary responsibilities.

## 2. Core Principles
Fundamental principles and guidelines to follow.

## 3. Process & Methodology
Step-by-step processes and workflows.

## 4. Implementation Preferences
Specific coding patterns and preferences.

## 5. Code Examples
Practical examples demonstrating correct patterns.

## 6. Common Pitfalls & Mistakes
Issues to avoid and anti-patterns.

## 7. Response Format
How AI responses should be structured.

## 8. Configuration
Any configuration options or settings.
```

### File Extensions & Location

- **Extension**: `.mdc` (Markdown Customization)
- **Location**: `.ai/rules/` directory and subdirectories
- **Naming**: Use kebab-case (e.g., `use-async-await.mdc`)

### Rule Loading Order

Rules are loaded in alphabetical order by default, which is why we use numbered prefixes (e.g., `00-core-agent.mdc`, `01-project-context.mdc`). This ensures foundational rules are processed first and can be referenced by later rules.

## Rule Format & Metadata

### Required Metadata Fields

```yaml
---
title: "Descriptive Title for the Rule"
description: "Brief summary of what the rule does and when to use it (max 500 chars)"
version: "1.0.0"           # Semantic versioning
lastUpdated: "2025-01-14"  # ISO date format (YYYY-MM-DD)
---
```

### Optional Metadata Fields

```yaml
---
# Organization and discovery
author: "Your Name"
tags: ["javascript", "react", "components"]
priority: 65              # Loading priority (0-100, higher = more important)

# Activation and compatibility  
globs: ["**/*.tsx", "**/*.jsx"]        # File patterns for auto-activation
alwaysApply: false                     # Whether rule always applies (default: false)
platforms: ["vscode", "cursor"]       # Compatible IDEs/platforms

# Integration and relationships
compatibleWith: ["vibe-coding-rules-3.0+"]  # Version compatibility
dependencies: ["01-project-context.mdc"]     # Required rules

# Examples and validation
examples:
  good:
    - "```jsx\n// Good example\n<Component />\n```"
  bad:
    - "```jsx\n// Bad example\n<div />\n```"
---
```

## Creating Custom Rules

### Step-by-Step Creation Process

1. **Identify the Need**
   - Determine what specific guidance your AI assistant requires
   - Identify gaps in existing rule coverage
   - Consider project-specific patterns or requirements

2. **Choose the Right Scope**
   - **Project-wide rule**: General patterns affecting entire project
   - **Technology-specific**: Framework or language-specific guidance
   - **Task-specific**: Workflow or process-oriented rules

3. **Select File Location and Name**
   ```
   .ai/rules/
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 00-core-agent.mdc           # Core behaviors (priority 90-100)
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 01-project-context.mdc     # Project context (priority 80-89)
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 02-common-errors.mdc       # Error patterns (priority 70-79)
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ languages/                 # Language rules (priority 60-69)
   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ TypeScript-Modern.mdc
   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Python3.mdc
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ technologies/              # Framework rules (priority 50-59)
   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ React.mdc
   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ NextJS.mdc
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ tasks/                     # Task workflows (priority 40-49)
   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Code-Review.mdc
   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Testing.mdc
   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ custom/                    # Custom rules (priority 0-39)
       ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ project-specific.mdc
   ```

4. **Create the Rule File**
   - Use kebab-case for filenames (`use-async-await.mdc`)
   - Include proper metadata header
   - Add directive sections with clear guidance
   - Include practical examples

5. **Test and Iterate**
   - Test with your AI assistant
   - Refine based on AI behavior
   - Get feedback from team members

## Rule Templating with Handlebars

VibeKit VDK CLI uses Handlebars templates to dynamically generate rule files based on project analysis. When creating custom templates, you can use the following Handlebars features:

### Variables

Access data using double curly braces:
```handlebars
{{projectName}}
{{date}}
{{frameworks}}
{{primaryLanguage}}
```

### Conditionals

Use if/else blocks to include content conditionally:
```handlebars
{{#if usingTypeScript}}
## TypeScript Configuration
Use strict TypeScript settings and proper typing.
{{else}}
## JavaScript Configuration
Follow ES6+ standards and use JSDoc for documentation.
{{/if}}
```

### Loops

Iterate over arrays:
```handlebars
## Detected Frameworks

{{#each frameworks}}
- **{{this.name}}**: {{this.description}}
{{/each}}
```

### Helper Functions

Use custom helper functions for more complex transformations:
```handlebars
{{#capitalize projectName}}{{/capitalize}}
{{#join libraries ", "}}{{/join}}
{{#formatDate lastUpdated}}{{/formatDate}}
```

### Template Example

```handlebars
---
title: "{{projectName}} Project Context"
description: "Project-specific patterns and conventions for {{projectName}}"
version: "1.0.0"
author: "{{author}}"
lastUpdated: "{{formatDate date}}"
tags: [{{#join tags '", "'}}{{/join}}]
---

# {{projectName}} Project Context

## 1. Project Overview
This is a {{projectType}} project using:
{{#each technologies}}
- **{{this.name}}** ({{this.version}})
{{/each}}

## 2. Architecture Patterns
{{#if architecture}}
The project follows {{architecture}} architecture with:
{{#each patterns}}
- {{this}}
{{/each}}
{{/if}}

## 3. Coding Conventions
{{#if namingConventions}}
### Naming Conventions
{{#each namingConventions}}
- **{{@key}}**: {{this}}
{{/each}}
{{/if}}
```

## Best Practices & Guidelines

### Rule Writing Best Practices

**Content Guidelines**
- **Be Specific**: Provide concrete examples rather than abstract principles
- **Stay Focused**: One rule per specific topic or workflow
- **Include Context**: Write assuming AI has limited project knowledge
- **Show Examples**: Demonstrate both good and bad patterns

**Structure Guidelines**
- Use clear headings (`#`, `##`, `###`) for organization
- Employ lists (`-`, `*`, `1.`) for actionable items
- Include code blocks with language specification
- Add examples demonstrating correct/incorrect patterns

**Writing Style**
- Write in active voice
- Use imperative mood for instructions
- Be concise but comprehensive
- Include rationale for complex decisions

### File Organization

**Directory Structure**
```
.ai/rules/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 00-core-agent.mdc           # Core AI behavior (priority 90-100)

    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ api-conventions.mdc
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ team-standards.mdc
```

**Naming Conventions**
- Use kebab-case for filenames
- Include descriptive names
- Add version numbers for major revisions
- Use consistent prefixes for series

### File References

Reference other files using the `@` symbol:
```markdown
For project context, see @../01-project-context.mdc
For implementation details, see @./utils/DatabaseHelper.ts
Check the authentication patterns in @../technologies/NextAuth.mdc
```

## Advanced Rule Features

### Rule Activation Mechanisms

Rules can be activated through three mechanisms:

#### 1. Automatic (Glob Pattern Matching)
When active files match patterns in the `globs` field:
```yaml
globs: ["**/*.py", "**/requirements.txt", "**/pyproject.toml"]
```

#### 2. Semantic (Description Matching)  
AI selects rules based on `description` relevance to current task or context.

#### 3. Explicit (Direct Reference)
Users can explicitly invoke rules:
- Chat mention: `@tasks/Code-Quality-Review.mdc`
- Direct request: "Use the refactoring guidelines"

### Priority System

Rules are prioritized by:
1. **Priority value** (0-100, higher takes precedence)
2. **Specificity** (more specific rules override general ones)
3. **Loading order** (alphabetical within same priority)
4. **Dependencies** (dependent rules load after their dependencies)

### Special Directives

Special directives use specific syntax for machine-readable instructions:

```markdown
!directive[parameter]{value}
```

Examples:
```markdown
!priority[implementation_style]{high}
!ignore[file_pattern]{node_modules/**}
!reference[rule]{01-project-context.mdc}
!memory[context]{architectural_decisions}
```

### Rule Dependencies

Specify rule dependencies to ensure proper loading order:

```yaml
---
dependencies: ["01-project-context.mdc", "languages/TypeScript-Modern.mdc"]
---
```

## Example Rules

### Language-Specific Rule Example

```yaml
---

# Modern TypeScript Best Practices

## 1. Role & Responsibility
You are a TypeScript expert focused on type safety, modern features, and best practices. Prioritize type correctness and developer experience.

## 2. Core Principles
- **Type Safety First**: Use strict TypeScript configuration
- **Explicit Types**: Prefer explicit types over `any`
- **Modern Features**: Use latest TypeScript features appropriately
- **Performance**: Consider compilation performance in type definitions

## 3. Implementation Preferences

### Type Definitions
- Use `interface` for object shapes that might be extended
- Use `type` for unions, intersections, and computed types
- Prefer `const assertions` for immutable data
- Use `satisfies` operator for type checking without widening

### Modern Patterns
```typescript
// Good: Using satisfies operator
const config = {
  apiUrl: 'https://api.example.com',
  timeout: 5000,
  retries: 3
} satisfies ApiConfig;

// Good: Const assertion for arrays
const statuses = ['pending', 'completed', 'failed'] as const;
type Status = typeof statuses[number];

// Good: Template literal types
type EventName<T extends string> = `on${Capitalize<T>}`;
```

## 4. Code Examples

### Good Examples
```typescript
// Interface for extensible objects
interface User {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  email: string;
}

// Type for unions and computed types  
type UserAction = 'create' | 'update' | 'delete';
type UserEventHandler = (user: User, action: UserAction) => void;

// Generic function with constraints
function processItems<T extends { id: string }>(
  items: T[], 
  processor: (item: T) => T
): T[] {
  return items.map(processor);
}
```

### Bad Examples
```typescript
// Avoid: Using any
function processData(data: any): any {
  return data.someProperty;
}

// Avoid: Overly complex generic constraints
function complexFunction<
  T extends Record<string, unknown> & { 
    [K in keyof T]: T[K] extends string ? T[K] : never 
  }
>(arg: T): T {
  return arg;
}
```

## 5. Common Pitfalls
- **Overusing `any`**: Use `unknown` or proper types instead
- **Type assertions without validation**: Use type guards instead
- **Complex generic constraints**: Keep generics simple and readable
- **Ignoring strict mode**: Always use strict TypeScript configuration

## 6. Response Format
When providing TypeScript code:
1. Include proper type annotations
2. Explain type choices when complex
3. Suggest type improvements for existing code
4. Reference TypeScript version features when relevant
```

### Task-Specific Rule Example

```yaml

title: "Task: Code Quality Review"
description: "Comprehensive code review process with quality standards and best practices"
version: "1.3.0"
author: "Quality Team"
lastUpdated: "2025-01-14"
tags: ["task", "code-review", "quality", "best-practices"]
globs: []  # Activated semantically
alwaysApply: false
priority: 45

users.forEach(user => {
  orders.forEach(order => {
    if (order.userId === user.id) {
      // Process order
    }
  });
});

// Good: Use Map for O(1) lookups
const userOrderMap = new Map();
orders.forEach(order => {
  if (!userOrderMap.has(order.userId)) {
    userOrderMap.set(order.userId, []);
  }
  userOrderMap.get(order.userId).push(order);
});
```

### Security Issues
