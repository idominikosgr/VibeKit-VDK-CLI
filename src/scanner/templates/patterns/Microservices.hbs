{{! Microservices Pattern Template }}

## Architecture: Microservices Pattern

This project follows the **Microservices** architectural pattern, which structures the application as a collection of loosely coupled services that implement business capabilities.

### Key Characteristics

- **Service Independence**: Each service operates independently and can be deployed separately
- **Decentralized Data Management**: Each service manages its own database
- **API Communication**: Services interact via well-defined APIs
- **Domain-Driven Design**: Services are organized around business domains
- **Infrastructure Automation**: DevOps practices for CI/CD and deployment

{{#if detectedServices}}
### Detected Services

{{#each detectedServices}}
#### {{this.name}}
- **Purpose**: {{this.purpose}}
- **API Path**: {{this.apiPath}}
- **Database**: {{this.database}}
- **Technology**: {{this.technology}}
{{/each}}
{{else}}
### Service Organization

Services should be organized around business capabilities and bounded contexts rather than technical functionality.
{{/if}}

### Communication Patterns

{{#if patterns.communicationType}}
This project uses **{{patterns.communicationType}}** for service communication:
{{#eq patterns.communicationType "Synchronous"}}
- **REST APIs**: Direct HTTP calls between services
- **gRPC**: For high-performance internal communication
- **GraphQL**: For flexible client-service interactions
{{else}}{{#eq patterns.communicationType "Asynchronous"}}
- **Message Queues**: {{patterns.messageQueue|default:"RabbitMQ/Kafka/etc."}}
- **Event-Driven**: Services publish and subscribe to events
- **Event Sourcing**: Track state changes as a sequence of events
{{else}}{{#eq patterns.communicationType "Hybrid"}}
- **Synchronous APIs**: For critical real-time operations
- **Asynchronous Events**: For non-blocking operations and notifications
- **CQRS**: Separate read and write operations for scaling
{{/eq}}{{/eq}}{{/eq}}
{{else}}
#### Available Communication Approaches
- **Synchronous**: REST/gRPC direct calls between services
- **Asynchronous**: Event-driven with message queues
- **Hybrid**: Combine synchronous and asynchronous as appropriate
{{/if}}

### Data Management

{{#if patterns.dataManagement}}
- **Data Storage**: {{patterns.dataManagement.storage}}
- **Data Consistency**: {{patterns.dataManagement.consistency}}
- **Transaction Pattern**: {{patterns.dataManagement.transaction}}
{{else}}
- **Database per Service**: Each service manages its own data storage
- **Eventual Consistency**: Accept that data will be eventually consistent
- **Saga Pattern**: Manage distributed transactions across services
{{/if}}

### API Gateway

{{#if apiGateway}}
This project uses **{{apiGateway.name}}** as the API Gateway:
- **Routes**: {{apiGateway.routes}}
- **Authentication**: {{apiGateway.auth}}
- **Rate Limiting**: {{apiGateway.rateLimiting|default:"Configured based on service requirements"}}
{{else}}
Implement an API Gateway to:
- Route requests to appropriate services
- Aggregate responses from multiple services
- Handle authentication and authorization
- Implement rate limiting and monitoring
{{/if}}

### Service Discovery

{{#if serviceDiscovery}}
Using **{{serviceDiscovery.name}}** for service discovery:
- **Registration**: {{serviceDiscovery.registration}}
- **Discovery**: {{serviceDiscovery.discovery}}
{{else}}
Implement service discovery to:
- Allow services to find each other without hardcoded locations
- Support dynamic scaling of service instances
- Handle service health monitoring
{{/if}}

### Best Practices

- **Single Responsibility**: Each service should focus on a single business capability
- **Independent Deployability**: Services should be deployable without affecting others
- **Resilience**: Implement circuit breakers, retries, and fallbacks
- **Observability**: Centralized logging, monitoring, and distributed tracing
- **API Versioning**: Plan for evolution of service APIs
- **Security**: Authentication, authorization, and secure communication

### Testing Approaches

- **Unit Tests**: Test individual service components
- **Integration Tests**: Test service interactions with other services
- **Contract Tests**: Verify API contracts between services
- **End-to-End Tests**: Test complete user scenarios across services

### Adaptation for Project Complexity

{{#eq complexity.level "high"}}
For this high-complexity microservices project:
- Implement sophisticated service mesh for communication control
- Use advanced monitoring and observability tools
- Implement comprehensive CI/CD pipelines for all services
- Consider multi-region deployment for high availability
- Implement advanced security with zero-trust architecture
{{else}}{{#eq complexity.level "medium"}}
For this medium-complexity microservices project:
- Focus on clear service boundaries and APIs
- Implement basic service mesh or API gateway
- Set up centralized logging and monitoring
- Establish standardized CI/CD pipelines
{{else}}
For this simpler microservices project:
- Start with a small number of well-defined services
- Use simple synchronous communication patterns
- Implement basic monitoring and tracing
- Consider a monorepo approach for easier maintenance
